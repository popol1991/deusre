    <p>
        <b style="font-size: 18px;">Introduction</b> <br />
        Thank you for participating in the evaluation of a new search engine designed to find
	data tables about neuroscience research.  If you want to know more about the project,
    see our <a href="http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/eager/deusre/">homepage</a>.  This web page provides a brief
	description of the task that you are asked to perform.
	At the bottom of the page there is a link that will take you to the search engine.
    </p>

    <p>
        The search engine contains about thirty thousand tables extracted from
	<a href="http://www.neuroelectro.org/">NeuroElectro.org</a> and journals published by
	<a href="http://www.elsevier.com/">Elsevier</a>.  NeuroElectro provided curated versions
	of tables published in a variety of sources.  The Elsevier tables were published in Elsevier neuroscience journals.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your task consists of two parts:  (i) Enter a query, and (ii) Assess the quality of
	each table that is returned.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
        <b style="font-size: 18px;">1. Entering Queries</b> <br />
	Queries consist of words and optional filters.  A few example queries are shown below.
    </p>

    <style type="text/css">
        td { padding:0 15px 0 15px; vertical-align: top; text-align: left; }
        th { padding:0 15px 0 15px; vertical-align: top; text-align: left; }
    </style>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Query</th>
            <th>Filters</th> 
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> occipital cortex </td>
            <td> </td>
            <td> A typical unstructured query</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> occipital cortex</td>
            <td> Value: 10, 50</td>
            <td> Prefer columns that contain values between 10 and 50.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> occipital cortex</td>
            <td> Value:  10, 50; Error: 0, 2 </td>
            <td> Also prefer columns that contain error values between 0 and 2.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Numerical filters can be added by clicking the <i>Add Filter</i> button.  There are
	11 filters.
	<i>Value</i>, <i>Error</i>, <i>Magnitude</i>, and <i>p-value</i> apply to values of cells.
	<i>Integer-Ratio</i>, <i>Real-Ratio</i>, <i>Mean</i>, <i>StdDev</i>, <i>Range</i>,
	<i>Accuracy</i>, and <i>Magnitude</i> apply to column statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please enter queries about topics that you know reasonably well.  You are free to use the filters if they seem
	useful, or ignore them, if they do not.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
        <b style="font-size: 18px;">2. Performing Quality Assessments</b> <br />
	<b>The most important part of the task</b> is your assessment of the quality of each
	table returned by the search engine.  Your assessments will be used to guide further
	development of the search engine, so it is important that they are as consistent and
	unbiased as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        To save screen space, the search engine only shows a few of top rows for
	each table.  To show the complete table, click the blue link on the upper right of
	each table.  Click on the same link to hide an expanded table.
    </p>
    <p>
        To avoid causing bias about which results are best, <b>search results are shown in
	a random order on the results page.</b>  This may feel awkward to you.  Most people are unconsciously
	accustomed to the relevance-based ranking used by commercial search engines, in
	which the best results are shown first.  Please try to remember that these results
	are in a random order.  <b>The best results may be located anywhere on the page.</b>
        Because results are shown in a random order, it may be a little difficult 
	to quickly get a sense of what the search engine found.  When the results are
	returned, please examine the first 5 tables to get a sense of what the search engine found,
	before you begin labeling tables.  This may help you to label tables more consistently.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please assign one of the following labels to each table.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Key Result:</b> This table is dedicated to the topic; authoritative and comprehensive, it is worthy of being a top result in a table search engine.</li>
        <li><b>Highly Relevant:</b> The content of this table provides substantial information on the topic.</li>
        <li><b>Relevant:</b> The content of this table provides some useful information on the topic, although it may be minimal.</li>
        <li><b>Not Relevant:</b> The content of this table does not provide useful information on the topic, but may provide useful information on other topics, including other interpretations of the same query.</li>
        <li><b>Broken:</b> This table is difficult to judge because it is broken or not readable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        After examining a table, please click one of the relevance labels.  When you have assessed all
        of the tables returned for the query, please click the <i>SAVE</i> button at the bottom of
	the page to save your assessments.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
        <b style="font-size: 18px;">Number of Queries</b> <br />
        We need as many queries and assessments as you are willing to provide.  We would like to ask you to
        enter at least 30 queries, and explore (if available) at least 50 results from each query.  
        However, you may stop at any time without consequences to yourself or our research, as long as
        you save the results after you have performed them.
    </p>
